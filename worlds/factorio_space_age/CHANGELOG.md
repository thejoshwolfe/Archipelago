# Factorio: Space Age apworld Changelog

## 2.3.1

* Guard against version mismatches between generation and runtime client.

## 2.3.0

* Now based on Factorio 2.1 🎉
    * The new `stellar-discovery-solar-system-edge` technology means that the `progressive-promethium` large group has one extra item.
    * Moving `biter-egg` and `nutrients-from-biter-egg` recipes to `biter-egg-handling` means the `progressive-captivity` large group has one extra item.
    * The default number of filler nothing items is now 3 instead of 4, because `biter-egg-handling` is no longer an empty technology.
    * As of writing this, Factorio 2.1.14 itself is still experimental. Please report bugs or incompatibilities, and thanks for being an early tester of both this apworld and Factorio 2.1!
* New YAML option `intermediate_technologies: unlocked` enabled by default, which unlocks 19 technologies from the start that only give intermediate products. This option doesn't give free samples for these intermediates. See https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/blob/space-age/worlds/factorio_space_age/data/ap_data.py for the list of technologies. [#37](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/37)
* New YAML option `production_and_utility_science: removed` disabled by default, which allows for a smaller scale game, particularly with shorter objectives like `goal: any_other_planet_science`.
* Research objectives beyond your configured goal are removed. For example, `goal: aquilo_orbit` will remove all research locations involving cryogenic science packs. When combined with `infinite_technologies: shuffle` (the default), infinite technologies beyond the goal are moved earlier instead of removed, copying the ingredients, prerequisites, and count formula of an earlier infinite technology. This can enable Factorio: Space Age players to unblock themselves by researching large progressive groups from infinite technology locations out of logic once enough science packs are unlocked, always at least chemical science. [#11](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/11)
* Fix filler items not contributing to their progressive group like they're supposed to.
* Improved information in the technology GUI:
    * Progressive chains are shown as dependencies between the inaccessible vanilla technologies, visualizing progressive chains. [#19](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/19)
    * Move multiworld item name from description to trigger description. Thanks @Enderdraak/@CosmicWolf for suggesting this in [#31](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/31) and [#30](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/pull/30).
    * Move localizable strings to `locale/en/locale.cfg` (no longer dynamically generated), which should enable third-party translations. Thanks @Enderdraak/@CosmicWolf for the reference implementation in [#30](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/pull/30).

## 2.2.4

* Fix infinite technologies again. Should work like I intended in the previous release now.

## 2.2.3

* Fix infinite technologies interacting weirdly with the multiworld: [#36](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/36)
    * When an infinite tech is part of a large progressive group, it gives the next tech in the group out of logic.
    * Infinite technology locations are no longer part of the multiworld, so they should not confuse trackers anymore. They are local only to the Factorio: Space Age slot.
    * Fix crash on release/collect.
* Further adjusted balance on `space_technology_level` to no longer reduce crafting time for `space-platform-foundation` and `rocket-silo`.

## 2.2.2

* Fix item duplication on server restart. Only applies to infinite techs, such as `worker-robot-speed-7`, which is included in `quick_start: true`. Thanks @lepideble for the implementation. [#29](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/pull/29)
* Adjusted balance on `space_technology_level` to no longer reduce the ingredient count for `space-platform-foundation`, `rocket-silo`, and rockets from rocket parts. Thanks to Hah and Silasary for playtesting and balance suggestions.

## 2.2.1

* Fix crash when your slot names contains a space. Thanks `@Silasary` for reporting this on Discord.

## 2.2.0

* The `pentapod_killers` option `"land mine"` is renamed and enhanced to `"land mine and construction robot"`. The old name is still accepted as an alias. Thanks `@super_sebby` for suggesting this on discord.
* The `pentapod_killers` and `demolisher_killers` options now accept partial specification. Missing keys fallback to their default values.
* Swapped `automation-3` earlier and `quantum-processor` later in the `progressive-circuit` chain. Thanks @ObsoleteDesign for suggesting this in [#24](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/24).
* Added `artillery` to the end of the `progressive-vulcanus` chain as a non-essential padding tech. Thanks @ObsoleteDesign for suggesting this in [#24](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/24).
* Fixed `progressive-portable-power` giving the fission and fusion equipment in the wrong order. Thanks @ObsoleteDesign for reporting this in [#23](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/23).
* Fixed the empty `bioflux-processing` tech appearing in the `progressive-gleba` chain when starting on Gleba. [#20](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/20)
* Fixed goals `aquilo_orbit_10_science` and `solar_system_edge_11_science` unlocking their final technology too early. [#25](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/25)
* Teleport Trap has been removed due to bugs. See [#18](https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/18) if you'd like to contribute a fix so that it can be re-enabled. The `teleport_trap_weight` option now does nothing and is documented as deprecated.

## 2.1.0

* Add `require_gun_turret_upgrades` option so you don't have to fly through space with no damage or speed upgrades. Fixes #15.

## 2.0.2

* Fix `filler_count` being ignored. Fixes #13.

## 2.0.1

* Fix corrupted apworld missing critical files.
* Actually bump the version number in the apworld and mod.

## 2.0.0

Lots of major new changes! Please report bugs and/or balance nightmares. There are a lot of combinations of cool options and I may have overlooked something.

### Gameplay changes

Default options are now a significantly accelerated experience relative to vanilla.

* Added `quick_start` option, enabled by default, that gives personal construction bots and a chunk of basic resources at the start.
* Added `skip_starting_trigger_techs` option, disabled by default, that starts with electronics, steam-power, etc. unlocked from the start without needing to do the crafting to trigger them. Free samples are given for skipped trigger techs.
* Added `starting_planet` option, disabled by default, that integrates with CodeGreen's Any Planet Start mod: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/any-planet-start . Interacts with `skip_starting_trigger_techs` and `free_samples` in fun ways.
* Added `space_technology_level` option to enable space flight with early or mid game technology, effectively downgrading all the ingredients for rocket silo, space platform, thruster, etc. to more primitive items. Puts the Space in Factorio: Space Age sooner rather than near the end of the game. (This could someday be obsoleted by recipe randomization.)
* Added `progressive_technologies: large_groups` option, enabled by default, which puts critical technologies, such as advanced circuit, early in large progressive chains with non-critical bonuses later in the chains. This makes it less likely to get stuck waiting for someone to find a specific item. Details here: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/blob/space-age/worlds/factorio_space_age/data/ap_data.py
* You can Ctrl+F search for vanilla technologies in the technology GUI, and the description tells you which progressive chain it's a part of, if any. (The technologies are impossible to queue up; they only serve to give information to the player about how to !hint for them.)
* `goal: any_other_planet_science` is now the default goal, and creates victory technologies to research instead of the mod reacting to researching anything that matches the condition. Includes low-effort art I drew of a trophy. Fixes #5.
* `goal: space_platform` replaced by `goal: space_science`, which requires researching a victory technology with 4 science packs including space science (red, green, blue, white).
* Managing enemies on Vulcanus and Gleba is now in logic, which is particularly important when starting on those planets. See options `demolisher_killers`, `pentapod_killers`, `vulcanus_rocks`, and `gleba_coal` for more details. Still no logic for Nauvis enemies.
* Added `tech_cost_max_count`, default 200, which limits the cost of technology research. Additionally `tech_cost_divisor` defaults to 4 now, so all research objectives are dramatically cheaper by default.

Minor adjustments:

* Energy Link is now enabled by default and the recipe is unlocked by a multiworld item.
* Furnaces, electric poles, and `military` through `military-4` recipe technologies are no longer progressive (with `progressive_technologies: only_related`). Getting the recipes out of order is interesting in a randomizer, because there are almost no crafting dependencies between them.
* `rocket-silo` research enables ghost entities on death (which normally requires `construction-robotics`). Fixes https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/Archipelago/issues/9 .

### Breaking changes to options

These changes may require updates to your player yaml configuration from v1.

* `progressive_technologies` has been completely overhauled. The old `bonuses` option is gone. The old `recipes` option is very similar to `only_related`. The default has changed to the new `large_groups` option.
* `goal: space_platform` removed. Try `goal: space_science` instead.
* `shuffle_final_technology` is now merged into `goal` with the addition of `aquilo_orbit_10_science` and `solar_system_edge_11_science`.
* The speedups `rocket_parts_per_rocket` and `ingredients_per_space_platform_foundation` are removed because they're now included in `space_technology_level`.
* `require_electric_furnace` has been renamed to `require_self_sufficient_space_platform`.
* `automation` (the first assembling machine technology) is no longer part of any progressive chain because it is never randomized.
* With some `progressive_technologies` settings, several progressive pseudo item names have been simplified to remove the `progressive-` prefix. E.g. `progressive-steel-plate-productivity` is now just called `steel-plate-productivity`, and `worker-robot-speed-1` through `worker-robot-speed-7` are part of a progressive group called simply `worker-robot-speed`. The rough generalization is that recipe unlock chains still say `progressive-` but bonus unlock chains don't.
* With `progressive_technologies: large_groups`, if you want to give yourself levels of an infinite tech that's part of a progressive group, name the last item in the chain rather than the chain itself. e.g. `!getitem worker-robot-speed-7` or `start_inventory_from_pool: {mining-productivity-3: 5}`.

### Internal changes

* Overhauled the logic pipeline to support configurable progressive groups, swappable recipes, and other hypothetical future flexibility. The data pipeline starts with Factorio's "prototype" data instead of "runtime" data, and we ship a pruned-down json file instead of generated python code. This change should make this apworld more friendly to contributors by being less confusing/clever/innovative/messy/etc. We do lose the git-controlled representation of the logic graph, which is a little disappointing, but necessary to make it more flexible.
* Fixed subtle bug with `on_entity_died` event handler clobbering found by @CosmicWolf. No observable change for the player. TODO: investigate using `on_player_died` instead.
* Fixed `/collect` on your own world printing `Unknown Item` warnings related to infinite technologies.
* Migrated the data exporter into this repo. Previously located here: https://github.com/thejoshwolfe/FactorioInformationExtractor
* The logic graph optimizer does more inlining, which results in fewer pedantic steps in the spoiler log for automating and accessing individual items. This could potentially influence progression balancing, but I really don't know if that's how the fill algorithm works.

## 1.1.2

* fixed Archipelago EnergyLink Bridge would not work on space platform.

## 1.1.1

* removed debug print when building an energylink bridge (oops).
* updated docs

## 1.1.0

* Added logic option to require heating towers or recyclers for automating gleba science

## 1.0.2

* Fix corrupted factorio mod generation due to version number conflict.

## 1.0.1

* Add logic option to require steel power poles on vulcanus and fulgora.
* Fix Archipelago required version to address a settings related crash.
* Fix typos in yaml option description.

## 1.0.0

Hello everyone! I've emerged from a 6 week frenzy seeing if I could tackle getting the Space Age expansion into Archipelago. It ended up taking a very different approach from the core Factorio world by Berserker et al.

### Differences from core Factorio

There are numerous necessary changes due to Space Age being kinda a completely different game,
but some of the notable design choices here that deviate from the core Factorio world are:

* Random recipe generation is removed.
* Random technology dependency generation is removed.
* Craftsanity is removed.
* The vanilla tech tree requirements and shape are preserved. Trigger techs and dependencies are all vanilla, but the effect of each research objective is random.
* Different groupings of progressive item chains.
* Infinite technologies are shuffled locally and optionally used as filler items.

There are also a ton of options to check out (template attached with this release).
